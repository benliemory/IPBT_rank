\title{
Variance estimate by empirical Bayes Hierarchical model (stHM)
}
\description{
This function estimates variance for each gene using empirical hierarchical model for stHM. After dividing the whole datasets into different groups, this function will be applied within each group.

  \item{subdata}{
Data matrix for genes in the same group.
